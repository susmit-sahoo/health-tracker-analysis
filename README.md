# Patient Vitals Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on analyzing periodic patient health data to monitor vital signs over time. The dataset includes measurements such as temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure (systolic/diastolic), and oxygen saturation. The goal is to identify trends, detect anomalies, and support predictive healthcare analytics.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains:
- **Patient ID**  
- **Date** of observation  
- **Body Temperature (Â°C)**  
- **Heart Rate (bpm)**  
- **Respiratory Rate (breaths/min)**  
- **Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)**  
- **Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)**  
- **Oxygen Saturation (%)**

Each patient has multiple records over different time periods, allowing for time-series analysis.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Visualization of health metrics over time  
- Detection of abnormal vital signs  
- Trend analysis for long-term monitoring  
- Potential integration with predictive models for early risk detection
